The purpose of creating a repository in GitHub is to store and organize the files. Using repository, people can collaborate and share codes easily. This program is aimed to subset the certain columns from the original datasets. There are two types of datasets, demographic data and dentition data. For the demographic data, columns SEQN, RIDAGEYR, RIDRETH3, DMDEDUC2, DMDMARTL, RIDSTATR, SDMVPSU, SDMVSTRA, WTMEC2YR, and WTINT2YR are selected into the clean dataset. Also, a column that categorizes the cohorts is created and appended to the clean dataset. For the dentition data, columns SEQN, OHDDESTS, OHXxxTC, and OHXxxCTC are included in the clean dataset. These clean datasets are stored in local as pickle files. The path to this file is https://github.com/cnuona/Stats507/blob/main/Q3_PS2.ipynb.
